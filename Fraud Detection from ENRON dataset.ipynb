    "In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.\n",
    "For this project, predictive models were built using scikit learn, numpy, and pandas modules in Python. The target of the predictions were persons-of-interest (POI’s) who were ‘individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement, or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.’ Financial compensation data and aggregate email statistics from the Enron Corpus were used as features for prediction.\n",
